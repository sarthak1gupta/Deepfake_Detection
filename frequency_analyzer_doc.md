# Frequency Domain Inspector - Detailed Documentation

## Overview

The Frequency Domain Inspector is a critical component of the multi-modal deepfake detection system that analyzes images in the frequency domain to detect synthetic artifacts that are often invisible in the spatial domain. This component leverages both Fourier Transform analysis and Wavelet Transform analysis to identify frequency-based inconsistencies characteristic of deepfake generation.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Frequency Domain Analysis in Deepfake Detection

**Why Frequency Analysis Works:**
- **GAN Artifacts**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) often introduce periodic patterns and frequency artifacts
- **Compression Artifacts**: Real images have natural compression patterns, while synthetic images may lack these
- **Upsampling Artifacts**: Deep learning models often create characteristic frequency signatures during upsampling
- **Spectral Density Differences**: Real and synthetic images have different energy distributions across frequency bands

### 2. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Analysis

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
F(u,v) = ∑∑ f(x,y) * e^(-j2π(ux/M + vy/N))
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Converts spatial domain image to frequency domain
- Magnitude spectrum reveals energy distribution
- Log transformation: `log(|F(u,v)| + 1)` enhances visualization
- Frequency shift centers low frequencies

**Detection Mechanism:**
- Real images: Natural frequency decay, organic noise patterns
- Fake images: Artificial frequency peaks, periodic artifacts, unnatural energy distribution

### 3. Wavelet Transform Analysis

**Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT):**
- Uses Daubechies 4 ('db4') wavelet
- Decomposes image into 4 subbands:
  - **cA (Approximation)**: Low-frequency content, general image structure
  - **cH (Horizontal Details)**: Horizontal edges and features
  - **cV (Vertical Details)**: Vertical edges and features  
  - **cD (Diagonal Details)**: Diagonal features and texture

**Advantages for Deepfake Detection:**
- Multi-resolution analysis reveals artifacts at different scales
- Edge preservation highlights synthetic boundaries
- Texture analysis exposes generated patterns
- Computational efficiency for real-time processing

## Architecture Deep Dive

### 1. Spectral CNN Branch

```python
self.spectral_cnn = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
    nn.BatchNorm2d(64),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
    nn.BatchNorm2d(128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
    nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
)
```

**Purpose**: Learns spatial frequency patterns directly from RGB input
**Design Rationale**:
- Progressive channel expansion (3→64→128→256) captures increasing complexity
- Batch normalization stabilizes training and reduces internal covariate shift
- ReLU activation introduces non-linearity while preserving positive frequency information
- AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1) creates global frequency signature regardless of input size

### 2. Wavelet Processing Branch

```python
self.wavelet_processor = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(256 * 4, 512),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.3)
)
```

**Input**: Concatenated wavelet coefficients (cA + cH + cV + cD)
**Processing**: 
- Linear transformation learns optimal combinations of wavelet features
- Dropout prevents overfitting to specific wavelet patterns
- 512-dimensional output provides rich representation

### 3. Feature Fusion Strategy

```python
self.fusion = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(256 + 512, feature_dim),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.3)
)
```

**Fusion Approach**: Early fusion concatenation
**Benefits**:
- Combines complementary frequency information
- Spectral CNN captures global frequency patterns
- Wavelet features provide localized multi-resolution analysis
- Joint learning optimizes both branches simultaneously

## Detailed Algorithm Workflow

### 1. Frequency Feature Extraction Process

```python
def extract_frequency_features(self, x):
    batch_size = x.shape[0]
    freq_features = []
    
    for i in range(batch_size):
        # Convert to grayscale for frequency analysis
        img = x[i].cpu().numpy().transpose(1, 2, 0)
        img_gray = cv2.cvtColor((img * 255).astype(np.uint8), cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
        
        # FFT Analysis
        f_transform = np.fft.fft2(img_gray)
        f_shift = np.fft.fftshift(f_transform)
        magnitude_spectrum = np.log(np.abs(f_shift) + 1)
        
        # Wavelet Analysis
        coeffs = pywt.dwt2(img_gray, 'db4')
        cA, (cH, cV, cD) = coeffs
        wavelet_features = np.concatenate([cA.flatten(), cH.flatten(), 
                                         cV.flatten(), cD.flatten()])
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Tensor to numpy conversion for OpenCV compatibility
   - RGB to grayscale conversion (frequency analysis typically done on single channel)
   - Denormalization to [0, 255] range

2. **FFT Analysis**:
   - 2D FFT computes frequency representation
   - fftshift centers zero frequency
   - Logarithmic magnitude extraction enhances dynamic range
   - Currently computed but not directly used (stored for potential future use)

3. **Wavelet Decomposition**:
   - Single-level DWT using Daubechies-4 wavelet
   - Extracts 4 coefficient matrices of different frequency bands
   - Flattening creates 1D feature vectors
   - Concatenation combines all wavelet information

4. **Feature Standardization**:
   - Ensures consistent feature vector size (256 * 4 = 1024)
   - Truncation for oversized features
   - Zero-padding for undersized features
   - Critical for batch processing stability

### 2. Forward Pass Logic

```python
def forward(self, x):
    spectral_features = self.spectral_cnn(x).flatten(1)
    wavelet_features = self.extract_frequency_features(x)
    wavelet_processed = self.wavelet_processor(wavelet_features)
    
    combined = torch.cat([spectral_features, wavelet_processed], dim=1)
    features = self.fusion(combined)
    output = self.classifier(features)
    
    return {
        'output': output,
        'features': features
    }
```

**Information Flow**:
1. **Parallel Processing**: Spectral CNN and wavelet extraction run independently
2. **Feature Concatenation**: Early fusion combines both feature types
3. **Joint Optimization**: Unified loss function trains both branches
4. **Multi-output Return**: Provides both classification and feature representations
