# Semantic Consistency Graph Neural Network (GNN)

## Overview
The Semantic Consistency GNN is an innovative component that leverages Graph Neural Networks to analyze facial landmark relationships and detect semantic inconsistencies in deepfake content. This approach models the face as a graph structure where landmarks are nodes and their relationships are edges, enabling the detection of unnatural facial geometry and eye/teeth anomalies.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Graph-Based Facial Representation
The system transforms facial landmarks into a graph structure:
- **Nodes**: 3D facial landmark coordinates (x, y, z)
- **Edges**: Spatial relationships between nearby landmarks
- **Graph Properties**: Captures geometric consistency and facial structure

### 2. Semantic Consistency Analysis
- **Geometric Relationships**: Analyzes distances and angles between facial features
- **Structural Integrity**: Validates anatomical correctness of facial arrangements
- **Temporal Consistency**: Maintains coherent facial structure across frames
- **Biological Plausibility**: Ensures realistic facial proportions and movements

## Architecture Deep Dive

### 1. Node Encoding Layer
```python
self.node_encoder = nn.Linear(3, 64)
```
**Purpose**: Transforms 3D landmark coordinates into higher-dimensional feature space
- **Input**: (x, y, z) coordinates for each landmark
- **Output**: 64-dimensional node embeddings
- **Function**: Creates rich representations of spatial positions

### 2. Graph Convolutional Layers
```python
self.gnn_layers = nn.ModuleList([
    gnn.GCNConv(64, 128),   # First GCN layer
    gnn.GCNConv(128, 256),  # Second GCN layer  
    gnn.GCNConv(256, 128)   # Third GCN layer
])
```

#### Layer-by-Layer Analysis:
- **Layer 1 (64→128)**: Initial feature expansion and local neighborhood aggregation
- **Layer 2 (128→256)**: Deep feature extraction and multi-hop relationships
- **Layer 3 (256→128)**: Feature compression and high-level pattern recognition

#### GCN Mathematical Foundation:
```
H^(l+1) = σ(D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2) H^(l) W^(l))
```
Where:
- `H^(l)`: Node features at layer l
- `A`: Adjacency matrix with self-connections
- `D`: Degree matrix
- `W^(l)`: Learnable weight matrix
- `σ`: Activation function (ReLU)

### 3. Graph Construction Strategy
```python
def create_face_graph(self, landmarks):
    # Create edges between nearby landmarks
    for i in range(len(landmark_coords)):
        for j in range(i+1, min(i+10, len(landmark_coords))):
            edges.append([i, j])
            edges.append([j, i])  # Undirected graph
```

#### Edge Creation Logic:
- **Local Connectivity**: Each landmark connects to next 10 landmarks
- **Undirected Edges**: Bidirectional information flow
- **Spatial Locality**: Preserves local facial structure relationships
- **Computational Efficiency**: Limited connectivity for scalability

### 4. Global Pooling and Aggregation
```python
self.global_pool = gnn.global_mean_pool
```
**Purpose**: Aggregates node-level features into graph-level representation
- **Mean Pooling**: Averages all node features
- **Permutation Invariant**: Order-independent graph representation
- **Fixed Output Size**: Consistent feature dimension regardless of landmark count

### 5. Feature Fusion Network
```python
self.fusion = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(128, feature_dim),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.3)
)
```
- **Dimensionality Transformation**: Maps graph features to standard feature space
- **Non-linear Activation**: Enables complex pattern learning
- **Regularization**: Dropout prevents overfitting

## Advanced Graph Concepts

### 1. Message Passing Framework
The GNN implements a message passing scheme:
1. **Message Computation**: Each node gathers information from neighbors
2. **Aggregation**: Combines neighbor messages (typically sum or mean)
3. **Update**: Transforms node features based on aggregated messages
4. **Iteration**: Repeats for multiple layers to capture multi-hop dependencies

### 2. Receptive Field Expansion
- **Layer 1**: Direct neighbors (1-hop)
- **Layer 2**: Neighbors of neighbors (2-hop)
- **Layer 3**: Extended neighborhood (3-hop)
- **Result**: Each node incorporates information from increasingly larger facial regions

### 3. Geometric Invariance Properties
- **Translation Invariance**: Robust to face position changes
- **Rotation Sensitivity**: Maintains orientation information for consistency checks
- **Scale Awareness**: Preserves relative proportions and distances

## Detection Capabilities

### 1. Geometric Inconsistencies
- **Landmark Displacement**: Detects unnaturally positioned facial features

### 2. Eye and Teeth Anomalies

### 3. Temporal Coherence
- **Landmark Tracking**: Maintains consistent feature positions across frames

- **Expression Transitions**: Ensures smooth emotional state changes
- **Geometric Stability**: Detects unrealistic facial deformations

## Training Methodology

    landmarks = self.landmark_extractor.extract_facial_landmarks(images)
```
